# BentoML Gallery

This is a collection of machine learning projects that utilizes [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)
for model serving. The goal is to demonstrate real-world BentoML usage and best practices in
productionizing a machine learning mdoel.


## Projects List

* Quickstart (sklearn on iris dataset): https://github.com/bentoml/gallery/tree/main/quickstart


## Project layout

Each gallery project is under its own folder, typically containing the following files:

| file name | description |
| --- | --- |
| README.md | a step-by-step guide running the project Python scripts from CLI |
| {PROJECT_NAME}.ipynb | a jupyter notebook shows the same workflow but from notebook environment |
| requirements.txt | required PyPI packages for this project |
| train.py | a python script for training an ML model and saving it with BentoML |
| import_model.py | import an existing trained model to BentoML |
| service.py | python code that defines the bentoml.Service instance for serving |
| bentofile.yaml | the bento build file for building the service into a Bento |
| .bentoignore | files to exclude from build directory, when building a Bento |
| benchmark.py | a python script that tests the baseline performance of the final model server created |
